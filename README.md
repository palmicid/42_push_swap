# 42_push_swap

finish with 86/100

I use Radix sort for this project (sort by binary since I have only 2 stacks)
and sort by my hands if there are 2 - 5.

Used linked list struct with 
int           num ---> store actual number
int           tag ---> index for sorting just the positive side and starting from 1
                       the original plan was to use a minus value if any error occurred
t_pswstruct   *next ---> point to the next one

You can look at my code starting from the push_swap.h file
It can guide you to any function in many files.


###Why??

I have no time XD

I saw my friend post a youtube video on the project discord channel 
and I tried coding just from that and read a bit more 
from https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/radix-sort/
